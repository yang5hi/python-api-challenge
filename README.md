key words: OpenWeather API, Google API

# Background
The project ulitizes the OpenWeather API and Google API to find the weather for a set of geographic cities with population over 500. Then the list of cities is reduced with locations and weather critiria. With the final city set, the hotels were listed for each cities under Google API search results.

# Part I -WeatherPy
* A series of scatter plots were created to showcase the following relationships:
  * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* The plots above were then seperated into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Linear regression were done on the following eright graphes.
  * Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
